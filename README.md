# First Django Admin

A step-by-step guide to creating a simple web application that empowers you to enlist reporters in data entry and refinement.

You will learn just enough about the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework to design database tables, load in data and create an administration panel for others to improve it. You will not bother with all the other web developer crap.

This tutorial uses Python 3 and Django 4.
