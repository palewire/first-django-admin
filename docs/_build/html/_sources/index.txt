First Django admin
==================

A step-by-step guide to creating a simple web application that empowers you to enlist reporters in data entry and refinement.

You will learn just enough about the `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_ framework to design database tables, load in data and create an administration panel for others to improve it. You will not bother with all the other web developer crap.

This guide in currently being developed by `Ben Welsh <http://palewi.re/who-is-ben-welsh/>`_ and Ken Schwencke for a workshop `scheduled for March 8 <http://ire.org/conferences/nicar2015/hands-on-training/>`_ at
the 2015 conference of the National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting in Atlanta.

   `github.com/ireapps/first-django-admin/ <https://github.com/ireapps/first-django-admin>`__
-  Issues:
   `github.com/ireapps/first-django-admin/issues/ <https://github.com/ireapps/first-django-admin/issues>`__

What you will make
------------------

This tutorial will guide you through creating a custom Django administration panel where reporters can inspect, edit and augment a list of invitees to the `Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences <http://www.oscars.org/>`_, the elite organization that decides the Oscars.

In 2012, `a study by the Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/academy/la-et-unmasking-oscar-academy-project-html-htmlstory.html>`_ found that the group is overwhelmingly white and male, which led to renewed calls to diversify the Oscar voting pool. A new list was used to write `a follow-up story <http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-et-mn-diversity-oscar-academy-members-20131221-story.html>`_ in 2013. The analysis appeared on the front page `again in early 2015 <http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-oscar-nominations-diversity-20150116-story.html#page=1>`_ when the academy was criticized after announcing a `virtually all-white slate <http://graphics.latimes.com/oscar-nominees-2015/>`_ of nominees.

By following the steps below, you will repeat The Times' work using the academy's 2014 invitation list, creating a system to share the load of producing a follow-up story in `this vein <http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-et-mn-diversity-oscar-academy-members-20131221-story.html>`_.

Prelude: Prerequisites
----------------------

Before you can begin, your computer needs the following tools installed
and working to participate.

1. A `command-line
   interface <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface>`__
   to interact with your computer
2. A `text editor <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor>`__ to work
   with plain text files
3. Version 2.7 of the
   `Python <http://python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/>`__ programming
   language
4. The `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_ package manager and `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`_ environment manager for Python


.. note::

  Depending on your experience and operating system, you might
  already be ready to go with everything above. If so, move on to the next
  chapter. If not, don't worry. And don't give up! It will be a bit of a
  slog but the instructions below will point you in the right direction.

.. _command-line-prereq:

Command-line interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unless something is wrong with your computer, there should be a way to
open a window that lets you type in commands. Different operating
systems give this tool slightly different names, but they all have some
form of it, and there are alternative programs you can install as well.

On Windows you can find the command-line interface by opening the
"command prompt." Here are instructions for `Windows
8 <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/command-prompt-faq#1TC=windows-8>`__
and `earlier
versions <http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window>`__. On Apple computers, you open the `"Terminal"
application <http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line>`__. Ubuntu Linux comes with a program of the `same
name <http://askubuntu.com/questions/38162/what-is-a-terminal-and-how-do-i-open-and-use-it>`__.

Text editor
~~~~~~~~~~~

A program like Microsoft Word, which can do all sorts of text formatting
like change the size and color of words, is not what you need. Do not
try to use it below.

You need a program that works with simple `"plain text"
files <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file>`__, and is therefore
capable of editing documents containing Python code, HTML markup and
other languages without dressing them up by adding anything extra. Such
programs are easy to find and some of the best ones are free, including
those below.

For Windows, I recommend installing
`Notepad++ <http://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`__. For Apple computers, try
`TextWrangler <http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/download.html>`__.
In Ubuntu Linux you can stick with the pre-installed
`gedit <https://help.ubuntu.com/community/gedit>`__ text editor.

Python
~~~~~~

If you are using Mac OSX or a common flavor of Linux, Python is probably
already installed and you can test to see what version, if any, is there
waiting for you by typing the following into your terminal.

.. code:: bash

    $ python -V

.. note::

    You don't have to type the "$" It's just a generic symbol
    geeks use to show they're working on the command line.

If you don't have Python installed (a more likely fate for Windows
users) try downloading and installing it from
`here <http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/>`__.

In Windows, it's also crucial to make sure that the Python program is
available on your system's ``PATH`` so it can be called from anywhere on
the command line. `This
screencast <http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=960000&fromSeriesID=96>`__
can guide you through that process.

Python 2.7 is preferred but you can probably find a way to make most of
this tutorial work with other versions if you futz a little.

.. _command-line-pip:

pip and virtualenv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `pip package manager <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_
makes it easy to install open-source libraries that
expand what you're able to do with Python. Later, we will use it to install everything
needed to create a working web application.

If you don't have it already, you can get pip by following
`these instructions <https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html>`_. In Windows, it's necessary to make sure that the
Python ``Scripts`` directory is available on your system's ``PATH`` so it can be called from anywhere on the command line. `This screencast <http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/video?name=960000&fromSeriesID=96>`_ can help.

Verify pip is installed with the following.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip -V

The `virtualenv environment manager <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/>`_
makes it possible to create an isolated corner of your computer where all the different
tools you use to build an application are sealed off.

It might not be obvious why you need this, but it quickly becomes important when you need to juggle different tools
for different projects on one computer. By developing your applications inside separate
virtualenv environments, you can use different versions of the same third-party Python libraries without a conflict.
You can also more easily recreate your project on another machine, handy when
you want to copy your code to a server that publishes pages on the Internet.

You can check if virtualenv is installed with the following.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ virtualenv --version

If you don't have it, install it with pip.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install virtualenv
    # If you're on a Mac or Linux and get an error saying you lack the right permissions, try it again as a superuser.
    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

If that doesn't work, `try following this advice <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html#installation>`_.

.. _activate:


Act 1: Hello Django
-------------------

Start by creating a new development environment with virtualenv. Name it after our application.

.. code-block:: bash

    # You don't have to type the "$" It's just a generic symbol
    # geeks use to show they're working on the command line.
    $ virtualenv first-django-admin

Jump into the directory it created.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd first-django-admin

Turn on the new virtualenv, which will instruct your terminal to only use those libraries installed
inside its sealed space. You only need to create the virtualenv once, but you'll need to repeat these
"activation" steps each time you return to working on this project.

.. code-block:: bash

    # In Linux or Mac OSX try this...
    $ . bin/activate
    # In Windows it might take something more like...
    $ cd Scripts
    $ activate
    $ cd ..

Make a new directory and move into it.

Use ``pip`` on the command line to install `Djang <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_, a Python "framework"
we'll use to put together our website.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install Django

Now use Django's ``django-admin`` command to create a new "project" that will be organized according to the framework's rules.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ django-admin startproject project

Now jump into the project and we'll start setting it up.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd project

.. note::

    Run the ``ls`` command (``dir`` on Windows), which lists the files in your current location. Wonder what all those weird files are in your new directory? We'll only need a couple for this tutorial, but you can read about all of them in the `official Django documentation <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/#creating-a-project>`_.

There is a lot of `configuration <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/intro/tutorial01/#database-setup>`_ that could be done at this point, but we're going to advance with all of the Django defaults in place.

The first step is creating your database, which will appear as new `SQLLite <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite>`_ file named ``db.sqlite3``.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py migrate

Fire up Django's built-in web server.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py runserver

Visit `localhost:8000 <http://localhost:8000>`_ in your browser to see Django in action. Here's what you should see.

.. image:: /_static/hello-django.png

Congratulations. You've installed Django and got a blank site started up and working. Now the real work begins.

Act 2: Hello models
-------------------

Now we create our app. In Django terms, an app is a collection of files that do something, like publish a blog or store public records. A project, like we made above, collects those apps and organizes them into a working website.

You can create a new app with Django's ``startapp` command. Since we are aiming to make a list of people invited to join the academy, naming this one isn't too hard.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python manage.py startapp academy

There should now be a new ``academy`` folder in your project. If you look inside you will see that Django created a series of files common to every app.

We will only be using two of them in this tutorial. The file called ``models.py`` is where we will design our database tables. Another called ``admin.py`` is where we will configure the panels where reporters will be able to enrich the source data.

But before we do any of that, we need to configure out project to include our new apps. Use your text editor to open the file ``settings.py`` in the ``project`` directory. Add our app, ``academy``, to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` list you find there.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 8

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'django.contrib.auth',
        'django.contrib.contenttypes',
        'django.contrib.sessions',
        'django.contrib.messages',
        'django.contrib.staticfiles',
        'academy',
    )

Next open up the ``models.py`` file in the ``academy`` app's directory. Here we will use Django's built-in `models <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/db/models/>`_ system to design a database table to hold the source data.

Each table is defined using a Python `class <http://www.learnpython.org/en/Classes_and_Objects>`_ that inherits special powers from Django allowing it to syncronize with an underlying database. Our work begins by creating our class and naming it after the data we'll put inside.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 4

  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Invite(models.Model):

Next, like any good database table, it needs some fields.

If you open `the source CSV <https://github.com/ireapps/first-django-admin/blob/master/academy_invites_2014.csv>`_, you will see that is has only two: name and branch. Both are filled with characters (as opposed to other data types like integers or dates).

Django also has some `fancy tricks <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/models/fields/>`_ for defining fields. Use them to define the fields from our source data.

.. note::

    Watch out. You'll need to carefully indent your code according to Python's very `strict rules <http://www.diveintopython.net/getting_to_know_python/indenting_code.html>`_ for this to work.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 5-6

    from django.db import models

    # Create your models here.
    class Invite(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
        branch = models.CharField(max_length=500)

Now let's add a few more fields that we will ask the reporters to figure out and fill in. We'll use another Django trick, the ``choices`` option, to make some of them multiple-choice fields rather than free text.

First gender.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 7-17

  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Invite(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
      branch = models.CharField(max_length=500)
      GENDER_CHOICES = (
        ("M", "Male"),
        ("F", "Female"),
        ("?", "Unknown")
      )
      gender = models.CharField(
          max_length=1,
          choices=GENDER_CHOICES,
          default="?"
      )

Then date of birth.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 17

  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Invite(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
      branch = models.CharField(max_length=500)
      GENDER_CHOICES = (
        ("M", "Male"),
        ("F", "Female"),
        ("?", "Unknown")
      )
      gender = models.CharField(
          max_length=1,
          choices=GENDER_CHOICES,
          default="?"
      )
      date_of_birth = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)

Race.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 18-31

  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Invite(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
      branch = models.CharField(max_length=500)
      GENDER_CHOICES = (
        ("M", "Male"),
        ("F", "Female"),
        ("?", "Unknown")
      )
      gender = models.CharField(
          max_length=1,
          choices=GENDER_CHOICES,
          default="?"
      )
      date_of_birth = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)
      RACE_CHOICES = (
          ("ASIAN", "Asian"),
          ("BLACK", "Black"),
          ("LATINO", "Latino"),
          ("WHITE", "White"),
          ("OTHER", "Other"),
          ("?", "Unknown"),
      )
      race = models.CharField(
          max_length=10,
          choices=RACE_CHOICES,
          default="?"
      )

Finally, an open-ended text field for reporters to leave notes about their decisions.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 31

  from django.db import models

  # Create your models here.
  class Invite(models.Model):
      name = models.CharField(max_length=500)
      branch = models.CharField(max_length=500)
      GENDER_CHOICES = (
        ("M", "Male"),
        ("F", "Female"),
        ("?", "Unknown")
      )
      gender = models.CharField(
          max_length=1,
          choices=GENDER_CHOICES,
          default="?"
      )
      date_of_birth = models.DateField(blank=True, null=True)
      RACE_CHOICES = (
          ("ASIAN", "Asian"),
          ("BLACK", "Black"),
          ("LATINO", "Latino"),
          ("WHITE", "White"),
          ("OTHER", "Other"),
          ("?", "Unknown"),
      )
      race = models.CharField(
          max_length=10,
          choices=RACE_CHOICES,
          default="?"
      )
      notes = models.TextField(blank=True)

Congratulations, you've written your first model. But it won't be created as a real table in your database until you run what Django calls a "migration." That's just a fancy word for syncing our models files.

Make sure to save your ``models.py``file. Then design the migration for your new model.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py makemigrations academy

Now run the ``migrate`` command to execute it.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py migrate academy

Act 3: Hello loader
-------------------

Our next challenge is to load the source CSV file into the model.

We are going to do this using Django's system for `custom management commands <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/howto/custom-management-commands/>`_. It allows us to make our own ``manage.py`` commands like ``migrate`` and ``startapp`` that take advantage of Django's bag of tricks and interact with the database.

To do this, add a ``management/commands`` directory in our academy app, complete with the empty ``__init__.py`` files required by Python. You can do this in your operating system's file explorer, or on the command line. From a Linux or OSX prompt that would look something like this.

.. code-block:: bash

  # The -p flag here makes both new directories
  $ mkdir -p academy/management/commands
  # This creates the empty files for Python
  $ touch academy/management/__init__.py
  $ touch academy/management/commands/__init__.py

When you're done the app's directory should look something like this.

.. code-block:: txt

  academy/
      __init__.py
      admin.py
      models.py
      management/
          __init__.py
          commands/
              __init__.py
      tests.py
      views.py

Create a new file in the ``management/commands`` directory where the new command will go. Let's call it ``loadacademycsv.py``.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ touch academy/management/commands/loadacademycsv.py

Open it up and paste in the skeleton common to all management commands.

.. code-block:: python

  from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

  class Command(BaseCommand):

      def handle(self, *args, **options):
          print "Loading CSV"

Running is as simple as invoking its name with ``manage.py``.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python manage.py loadacademycsv

Download `the source CSV file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ireapps/first-django-admin/master/academy_invites_2014.csv>`_ from GitHub and store in your base directory next to ``manage.py``.

Return to the management command and introduce Python's built-in `csv module <https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html>`_ to convert the CSV into a list and print each record.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 1,2,3,10-15

  import os
  import csv
  from django.conf import settings
  from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

  class Command(BaseCommand):

      def handle(self, *args, **options):
          print "Loading CSV"
          csv_path = os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, "academy_invites_2014.csv")
          csv_file = open(csv_path, 'rb')
          csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
          for row in csv_reader:
              print row

Run it to see what we mean.

.. code-block:: bash

  $ python manage.py loadacademycsv

Import our model into the command and use it to save the CSV records to the database.

.. code-block:: python
  :emphasize-lines: 4,15-16

  import os
  import csv
  from django.conf import settings
  from academy.models import Invite
  from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand

  class Command(BaseCommand):

      def handle(self, *args, **options):
          print "Loading CSV"
          csv_path = os.path.join(settings.BASE_DIR, "academy_invites_2014.csv")
          csv_file = open(csv_path, 'rb')
          csv_reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
          for row in csv_reader:
              obj = Invite.objects.create(name=row['name'], branch=row['branch'])
              print obj

Act 4: Hello admin
------------------

- Configure the admin vanilla.
- Create a superuser
- Check out how the vanilla admin looks
- Configure an admin for our model
- Tweak our admin so it's nicer
- Create users for the reporters

Then create a new superuser with permission to edit all records.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py createsuperuser

- Create an admin to access and edit the new model
- Gradually refine it so it's better

Act 5: Hello Internet
---------------------

Instructions for after you get home about how to host it on Amazon or something like that.

- Show how the 0.0.0.0 trick works
- Explain alternatives, like under your desk, in the cloud, etc.
- Show how to do it with Heroku maybe?
