# First Django Admin

A step-by-step guide to creating a simple web application that empowers you to enlist reporters in data entry and refinement.

You will learn just enough about the [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework to design database tables, load in data and create an administration panel for others to improve it. You will not bother with all the other web developer crap.
